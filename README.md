## Goal

Defining [WP Password Argon Two](https://github.com/TypistTech/wp-password-argon-two) required constants in application code violates [12-factor principle](https://12factor.net/).

This package allows you configure [WP Password Argon Two](https://github.com/TypistTech/wp-password-argon-two) with environment variables.

## Installation

```bash
âžœ composer require typisttech/wp-password-argon-two-env
```

In `wp-config.php` or [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock)'s `config/application.php`:
```php
TypistTech\WPPasswordArgonTwo\Env\Converter::run();
```

## Usage

On your server, define these environment variables:

* `WP_PASSWORD_ARGON_TWO_PEPPER`
* `WP_PASSWORD_ARGON_TWO_OPTION_MEMORY_COST`
* `WP_PASSWORD_ARGON_TWO_OPTION_TIME_COST`
* `WP_PASSWORD_ARGON_TWO_OPTION_THREADS`
* `WP_PASSWORD_ARGON_TWO_FALLBACK_PEPPER_<integer>`

Only `WP_PASSWORD_ARGON_TWO_PEPPER` is required. Others are optional.

Fallback peppers must start with `1` and consecutive. For example:

* `WP_PASSWORD_ARGON_TWO_FALLBACK_PEPPER_1`
* `WP_PASSWORD_ARGON_TWO_FALLBACK_PEPPER_2`
* `WP_PASSWORD_ARGON_TWO_FALLBACK_PEPPER_3`

### Trellis

[Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis) users could add environment variables under [`wordpress_sites`](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/wordpress-sites/#options):
```yml
# group_vars/<env>/vault.yml
vault_wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    env:
      wp_password_argon_two_pepper: 'your_long_and_random_pepper'
      wp_password_argon_two_fallback_pepper_1: 'your_second_oldest_pepper'
      wp_password_argon_two_fallback_pepper_2: 'your_oldest_pepper'

# group_vars/<env>/wordpress_sites.yml
wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    env:
      wp_password_argon_two_option_memory_cost: 131072 # 128 Mb
      wp_password_argon_two_option_time_cost: 4
      wp_password_argon_two_option_threads: 3
```

Encrypting `vault.yml` files is important! Learn more on [Trellis docs](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/).
